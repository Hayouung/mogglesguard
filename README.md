# Mogglesguard

> Hearken unto me, brave Mogglesguard! These villains shall threaten you no more!

This is a Discord bot made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

# Getting started

I expect you to have Node.js installed.

### Setup config

In `example.env`, change the tokens and IDs then rename the file to `.env`.

Read [this](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) if you don't know how to get those.

### Deploy commands

Deploy commands to just your server (useful for testing) with:
    
    npm run deploy

... or globally with

    npm run deploy:global

### Finally... run bot

    npm start

If you see, `pog` in the console, then the bot is up and running.

Hail to the king, kupo!

# Usage

- `/kupo` - random quote from the Mogglesguard
- `/goodkingmogglemog` - Good King Moggle Mog, Good King Mog...

# Clearing commands

In case you decide to be a monster and want to remove the kupos, you can clear commands the same way you deploy but instead of `deploy`, you use `clear`

    npm run clear
    npm run clear:global
